---

I work as a full time web developer for Mozilla, with main focus on [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), Python, and PHP. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of California at Santa Cruz. I've been involved with Mozilla since June 2008.

Web development has been my passion since 2006, and I have, on occasion, worked on or volunteered for several other sites. See [my resume](http://craciunoiu.net/files/docs/paul_resume.pdf) for tech details about me, or [this page](http://craciunoiu.net/portfolio) for a portfolio of sorts.
