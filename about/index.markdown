---

I work as a web developer for [Mozilla](http://mozilla.com), with main focus on [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com), Python, and PHP. I am also pursuing an undergraduate degree at [University of California at Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu), graduating in June 2010.

Web development has been my passion since 2006, and I have, on occasion, worked or volunteered for several other sites. See [my resume](http://craciunoiu.net/files/docs/paul_resume.pdf) for tech details about me, or [this page](http://craciunoiu.net/portfolio) for a portfolio of sorts.
