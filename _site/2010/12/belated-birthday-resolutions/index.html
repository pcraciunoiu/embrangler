<h2 id='why'>Why?</h2>

<p>It was my birthday recently. And I&#8217;ve always been a fan of resolutions. I look at them as an opportunity to learn, plan something great, and stick with it.</p>

<p>Also, posting them here is an incentive to follow through! By all means, remind me of what promised to achieve next year and make me feel bad if it doesn&#8217;t happen :D</p>

<h2 id='thanks_previous_year'>Thanks, previous year!</h2>

<p>First, I&#8217;ll take the opportunity to look back on my previous year and what has gone well. Be thankful, yada yada.</p>

<ol>
<li>Finished my undergraduate education while working an average of 25 hours per week (last two quarters). Thank you, <a href='http://ucsc.edu'>UC Santa Cruz</a> for having a good CS program and gathering a bunch of smart engineers too. I am truly grateful of all the opportunities UCSC has offered me.</li>

<li>Learned a <em>ton</em> about web development, the web in general. I&#8217;m much more confident with the knowledge acquired about my field now. Thank you, Mozilla (mostly webdevs ;) for that. And also thank you, internet!</li>

<li>Became much more organized and productive. (This is something I look forward to growing even further in the next year.) Thanks to people I&#8217;ve spoken with, a bunch of books I&#8217;ve read and talks I&#8217;ve listened to, as well as one, very interesting seminar at UC Santa Cruz entitled &#8220;Transformative Action&#8221;.</li>

<li>Traveled to a bunch of places (Romania, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Miami, Yosemite, etc) which motivated me to make <a href='/list/'>a list</a>. I am thankful to really good friends (one in particular) without whom I would not have done this!</li>

<li>Slowly but surely came to a decision about going back to school: will wait for at least one more year before applying to graduate schools. Maybe more.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='what_now'>What now?</h2>

<p>For this next year, I&#8217;ve decided to keep it simple. Just <strong>4 concrete actions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href='#understand_my_place_on_the_web'>Understand my place on the web</a></li>

<li><a href='#take_more_risks'>Take more risks</a></li>

<li><a href='#take_more_steps_back_think_ahead'>Take more steps back, think ahead</a></li>

<li><a href='#use_the_power_of_choice'>Use the power of choice</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id='understand_my_place_on_the_web'>Understand my place on the web</h3>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll be honest - this one is a stretch. How about just understanding it better??</p>

<p>I know I want to be on the web. What exactly would my role be? What could <strong><em>I</em></strong> do that would make the most difference and at the same time coincide with my values. For this year, I will probably look at this more from a web developer&#8217;s perspective than anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Ultimate goal:</strong> more confident about the purpose of my contributions to the world.</p>

<h3 id='take_more_risks'>Take more risks</h3>

<p>True - this year has had its risks (jumping from a plane, some crazy hikes, other social or work-related acts that were out of my comfort zone), but by and large, I haven&#8217;t taken chances as much as I know I can. I also want to be more confident in my abilities and this will help.</p>

<p>I want to become more open to risk. Maybe I will try something like <a href='http://sneakylittlefox.tumblr.com/post/2053967413/rejection-therapy-an-introduction'>rejection therapy</a>. The areas I want to focus on are:</p>

<ul>
<li>social skillzz - uh, need I say more? computer nerd + social skills = ???</li>

<li>webdev work - initiative, initiative, initiative</li>

<li>UX - sometimes I don&#8217;t do as good of a job on UI/UX because I stick with the comfy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ultimate goal:</strong> become much more comfortable with failure.</p>

<h3 id='take_more_steps_back_think_ahead'>Take more steps back, think ahead</h3>

<p>Getting over-involved in little things can make me forget about what&#8217;s really important. I want to think about the future more and the past less. That&#8217;s what my <a href='http://www.thetimeparadox.com/surveys/ztpi/'>ZTPI</a> index indicates too ;)</p>

<ul>
<li>Decide on when I will go back to school</li>

<li>Elaborate on what I see happening for me in the next 2-5 years (I&#8217;ll be happy with 2, but 5 would be an overachievement :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ultimate goal:</strong> In the words of Brian Tracy and Philip Zimbardo, I want to <em>expand my time perspective</em>.</p>

<h3 id='use_the_power_of_choice'>Use the power of choice</h3>

<p>Choice empowers us. Two things here:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to make an active choice when the opportunity arises - instead of, say, passively deferring.</li>

<li>Say <em>no</em> more. Much too often I try to be nice and say yes, but time does not permit me to do everything.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Ultimate goal:</strong> become more realistic about how much I can really do, and stop feeling like a victim sometimes.</p>

<h2 id='onward_i_say'>Onward, I say!</h2>

<p>12 months from now, <strong>I will</strong> report back. Seriously.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who made this year of my life awesome!</p>
