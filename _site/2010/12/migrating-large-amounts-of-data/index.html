  <p>Data migration is a complicated problem. It&#8217;s one of those things nobody wants to do, because it&#8217;s mostly tedious, not engaging, and also important to get right. Often times you have to compromise. I&#8217;ll talk a bit about the history of SUMO&#8217;s data, decisions the product and development team have made regarding its migration, and things I&#8217;ve learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id='quick_tips'>Quick tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Start with the smallest dataset first to get the hang of things. (<a href='#rewriting_where_to_start'>details</a>)</li>

<li>You&#8217;ll have to deal with lots of edge cases. Make sure to write tests. (<a href='#testing'>details</a>)</li>

<li>Careful when converting dates/times: timezones can be a pain, and data is often stored in the timezone of the server. (<a href='#converting_data'>details</a>)</li>

<li>When you have so much data that migrating it would take days: do you need <em>all</em> of it? (<a href='#too_much_data'>details</a>)</li>

<li>Consider the benefits of migrating data offline (<a href='#migrating_the_knowledge_base'>details</a>)</li>

<li>It&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll be able to use raw SQL. (<a href='#can_i_get_away_with_pure_sql'>details</a>)</li>

<li>You&#8217;ll learn how important data integrity is, so you&#8217;ll pay attention at the schema your software uses next time. (<a href='#data_integrity_and_storage'>details</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='background'>Background</h2>

<p>At the beginning of February, <a href='http://support.mozilla.com'>SUMO</a> started on a new adventure: rewriting the entire platform from an outdated version of <a href='http://tikiwiki.org/'>TikiWiki</a> to <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>Django</a>. As different (more or less stand-alone) pieces of the application were moved over to the new platform, our data had to be migrated over as well.</p>

<p>Over the course of the past 6 months, I&#8217;ve migrated over 25,000 pieces of content, most of which contained large amounts of text data.</p>

<h2 id='rewriting_where_to_start'>Rewriting: where to start?</h2>

<p><strong><em>Tip: Start with the smallest, simplest dataset first.</em></strong></p>

<p>The first migration of data was part of our new <a href='http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forums'>discussion forums</a>. This was by far the smallest component we had to migrate over:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the forums contained roughly 5000 posts, in just about 1000 threads.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>by comparison, we had a total of ~450,000 answers for ~260,000 questions, and over 5,000 knowledge base pages.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions'>questions</a></li>

<li><a href='http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Using%20Firefox'>knowledge base, document example</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>I had never done migrations before, so starting small was a good idea.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In addition to being the smallest, the forums content was also more straightforward to migrate (see also <a href='#converting_data'>Converting data</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='too_much_data'>Too much data!!</h2>

<p>Our questions component had over 450,000 (!) answers in the old system. Should you ever be in this situation, here are some options worth considering:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>do you need all this data? can you keep just a reasonable portion of it?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>if you don&#8217;t, great! (<a href='#migrating_questions'>details</a>)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>if you <strong>do</strong>, tough luck. Consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>migrating data offline and then running a straighforward SQL import on the production database. (<a href='#migrating_the_knowledge_base'>details</a>)</li>

<li>running the conversion script in chunks: migrate a part of the data now, and more later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='migrating_questions'>Migrating questions</h3>

<p>Fortunately, even though we had over 260,000 questions to migrate, only about 15,000 were recent enough to be relevant for the currently supported versions of <a href='http://getfirefox.com'>Firefox</a>. Hence, the development and product teams agreed to <em>not</em> migrate all of them.</p>

<p>The script to convert data over was run live on the production server, and took over one hour to finish - not too bad.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> frozen edits to and creation of TikiWiki questions for those a bit over an hour.</p>

<h3 id='migrating_the_knowledge_base'>Migrating the Knowledge Base</h3>

<p>The Knowledge base presented a different situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Between 5,000 and 6,000 articles, some with long-standing history</li>

<li>Approved and unreviewed versions of an article were stored as separate articles in TikiWiki (each with its own history)</li>

<li>Lots and lots of content and metadata <em>per document</em></li>

<li>Changing our wiki syntax from <a href='http://tiki.org/tiki-index.php?page=WikiSyntax'>TikiWiki</a> to <a href='http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting'>MediaWiki</a> (used by <a href='http://www.wikipedia.org/'>Wikipedia</a>, among many others).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, even though the <em>count</em> was much lower than for forums or questions, migrating these was much more intensive, both CPU and IO-wise.</p>

<p><strong>Our solution</strong> here was to run the script offline (a.k.a. I ran the script on my machine) and hand our IT team just the SQL output to import.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> The script was complex enough to take <em>over 3 hours</em> from start to finish. Unreasonable to run on our production servers: if something went wrong, it could take an entire workday (or more) for the IT and development team to get things back on track.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> frozen edits to and creation of TikiWiki knowledge base articles for a day.</p>

<p><strong>Huge benefits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the data migration took less than <strong>5 minutes</strong> to import on the production database.</li>

<li>no worrying about a script crashing on untested data</li>

<li>no overloading the production servers with database queries (replication lag can be an issue)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='can_i_get_away_with_pure_sql'>Can I get away with pure SQL?</h2>

<p><strong><em>Rarely.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Data <strong>changes frequently</strong> over time.</li>

<li>Thus, you want to freeze changes for the <strong>minimum possible time</strong>, so running a script on the production database is the way to go.</li>

<li>Hence, unless the new schema structure is close enough for raw SQL to handle, you&#8217;re out of luck.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only time we were able to use pure SQL was when <a href='#migrating_the_knowledge-base'>we froze edits for a day</a> and generated the SQL offline.</p>

<p><strong>How similar does schema structure have to be for SQL to work?</strong> you ask.</p>

<p>Here is the story for our <a href='http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forums'>forums</a>, the <strong>simplest schema:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>we kept the general structure of the data: forum with threads as children, and threads with posts as children.</li>

<li>in TikiWiki, our threads and posts were stored in the same table, with a parentId column distinguishing which are threads and which are posts.</li>

<li>in Django, threads had their own table (a good <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization'>normalization</a> to have).</li>

<li>a thread from TikiWiki mapped to a thread + a post in Django</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of those (and other) differences, we couldn&#8217;t run a SQL-only import as reliably as a python/PHP conversion script. You could try doing a SQL-only import, but you&#8217;re gonna hit some <strong>key issues you wish SQL could solve:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>while + if/else if/else structures. Much too often, data is corrupted or columns contain unexpected values - <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/control-flow-functions.html#function_if'>MySQL&#8217;s conditional construct</a> doesn&#8217;t do much.</li>

<li>colliding unique keys, or integrity errors due to foreign key references are <em>very</em> difficult to prevent against in SQL.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='converting_data'>Converting data</h2>

<p>Here are some general observations of problems you might run into when converting data, based on our problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Frequently, <strong>normalization</strong>/denormalization changes are <strong>worth the effort</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>More often than not, normalization is the way to go.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Long-term benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data integrity a <a href='#data_integrity_and_storage'><strong><em>huge issue</em></strong></a>.</li>

<li>Usually, more flexibility to add functionality later on.</li>

<li>Easier migration (should you need to do it again).</li>

<li><a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=benefits+of+normalization'>And more!</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Syntax changes</strong> are <strong>the worst</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have to change wiki syntax, consider going straight to HTML: this way, you can use the rendered output of the documents from the old platform.</li>

<li>Can&#8217;t get away with just HTML? Try regex conversion! I&#8217;m not saying that using a proper parser is a bad idea &#8211; but if you have to <strong>write a parser</strong>, it&#8217;s probably not worth the effort.</li>

<li>Consider a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton'>simple PDA</a> instead of a parser, it might just work.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Dates and times are <strong>timezone-sensitive</strong>. When converting, make sure to test that you&#8217;re taking timezones into account.</p>

<ul>
<li>In our case, we were moving over from a basically timezone-ignorant platform (as many PHP applications are), to a timezone-sensitive application (Django).</li>

<li>Some columns were integers (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time'>UNIX timestamps</a>), which are universally based on UTC, and so less tricky to convert. MySQL&#8217;s <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_from-unixtime'>FROM_UNIXTIME</a> can be useful here.</li>

<li>Others were mysql dates/datetimes/timestamps, recorded at the server&#8217;s timezone (for us, US/Pacific, or PDT).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Be prepared for <strong>lots and lots of edge cases:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax changes are a nightmare of edge cases, as the old syntax probably has different rules and a different parser than the new one. One common problem for us was whitespace handling.</li>

<li>If foreign keys were not (well) enforced in the old system, there will be numerous exceptions to catch in the new one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='data_integrity_and_storage'>Data integrity and storage</h3>

<p>One of the most valuable lessons to learn from migrating data is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity'>integrity</a>. Another one is storing data properly encoded and consistently. I&#8217;ll highlight just a few things that help with respect to data migration:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Use foreign keys and any other constraints as much as technically accurate</p>

<ul>
<li>E.g. you will have fewer exceptions to handle if you can rely on foreign keys to refer to valid rows</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Storing text in one encoding is better than multiple; preferably unicode.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Store dates and times in the same timezone; preferably UTC.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use a database that <a href='http://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/django-fixtures-with-circular-foreign-keys-480/'>supports deferred foreign key checks</a>, and is generally better about <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID'>ACID</a>. That&#8217;s not MySQL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='testing'>Testing</h2>

<p>Although testing some temporary code that you&#8217;ll use once may seem like a waste, if you&#8217;re dealing with large amounts of data that can change, you will be better off writing tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover the basics - migrating a typical piece of content.</li>

<li>Cover some, if not all of the edge cases.</li>

<li>(somewhat related to testing) Write some helper scripts (e.g. bash) to make it easy to run the migration and spot check.</li>
</ul>

<p>I worked on migrating the Knowledge Base over several weeks, and sometimes changes I made to the script broke tests &#8211; if it wasn&#8217;t for those tests, lots of content could have been migrated poorly, or not at all.</p>
