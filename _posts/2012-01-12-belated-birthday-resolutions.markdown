I'm a month late on [my promise](http://embrangler.com/2010/12/belated-birthday-resolutions/#onward_i_say). But it can still be a tradition.

## Why?

It's been a new year. And my birthday. In 2011, so much has changed that I could spend weeks just thinking about it, doing nothing else, and still learning from it.

I [wrote a similar post](http://embrangler.com/2010/12/belated-birthday-resolutions/) shortly after my last birthday, and I like the title so I'm keeping it.

## Thanks, previous year!

Looking back to the end of 2010, I had set out to fulfill 4 concrete goals:

1. Understand my place on the web
2. Take more risks
3. Take more steps back, think ahead
4. Use the power of choice

Time to grade myself :)

## 1. Understand my place on the web.

__Grade: D+__

I knew this was a stretch - I am still not sure where I want to be. In 2011, I moved from [being a web developer at Mozilla](http://mozilla.com) to starting my own company, [SoWink](http://sowink.com). I learned that working for a social product is extremely fun. I recently increased my open source contributions to the web as a whole and am planning to continue this trend.

But do I really understand where I want to be years from now? Or even this year? No. I'm considering this goal a moderate success, but mostly __a failure__. A failure from which I should be learning a lesson. What is that lesson? I'll have to think about it...

### 2. Take more risks

__Grade: A-__

Definitely achieved. Starting a company, moving, traveling alone, going hang gliding.

It would have been even better if I had taken more time to learn more about the non-technical essentials of running a company. But that would have taken time from something else, surely.

### 3. Take more steps back, think ahead

__Grade: B__

I've spent some time thinking about my future, life, and what matters. This is worth a separate blog post in itself. I'm still not satisfied with my time perspective. I want to spend more time thinking about the big picture. I want to have a better grasp of the next few years, and maintain a better balance in my life.

I want to thank the people closest to me for asking me thought-provoking questions throughout the year that have encouraged me to do this more.

### 4. Use the power of choice

__Grade: A__

While I have still occasionally victimized myself, I understand now that it is difficult not to - especially when under heavy stress. But the past year has taught me to say no more, to negotiate better, to actively choose my path. Most of all, it has taught me that *I do* have the power of choice, that *I can* do what I want, and that grabbing an opportunity and making the most of it can really change one's life.

Working at a startup, I have had to continually adjust my expectations, evaluate how the product has been going, how much work can really be done, become better at estimating and less worried about missing deadlines. I went through several failures, delayed launches, intense debates and arguments.

Failing fast and often has taught me how to deal with stress better. It has the downside of not giving you enough time to think and learn from it, so I'd like to take some time this month of January to think back more and jot down lessons learned.

## What now?
