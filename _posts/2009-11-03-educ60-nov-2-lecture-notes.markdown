Ideas about teaching:

* Pedagogical content knowledge
* Culturally responsive teaching
* Teacher as facilitator
* Teacher learning
* Teacher learning communities

Community of practices

* Common ways of doing things, common structure of teaching

Quick review

* Behaviorism and teaching
	* a response to a stimulus is enforced
	* vs teaching - positive and negative reinforcement techniques

* Constructivism
	* teacher is guide or facilitator
	* work that ZPD!
	* research what students know
	* hands-on problem solving
	* open-ended questions

* Community of practice
	* shared language and practices
	* establish, promote and understand student communities
	* provide scaffolding/mentoring
	* scaffolding = diagnosing of ZPD; hinting, leading question based on what student already knows
	* the best assessment occurs in the practice

Pedagogical knowledge

* of subject matter
* of students' understanding
* of curricula
* of general pedagogy

Content knowledge

* of subjects
* of relationships among subjects
* of methods of acquiring and applying knowledge

Culturally responsive teaching

* who are my students? where do they live? what are typical parental occupations? what "funds of knowledge" are family members able to share
* funds of knowledge = intersting important ideas that individual haves which are not parts of school
* build outside knowledge into curriculum, goes back to knowing how people learn

Teacher as facilitator vs didactic

* having students contribute from their own experiences
* involves some kind of egalitarian effort

"Teaching for understanding" paper, by Perkins
1. Make learning a long-term, thinking-centered process
1. Provide rich ongoing assesment
1. Support learning with powerful representations
1. Pay heed to developmental factors
1. Induct students into the discipline

	* e.g. think like historians
1. Teach for transfer

	* e.g. use information in more than one setting

__We all need to be reflective, lifelong learners.__

Teacher learning communities

* Mutual Support
* Shared Focus
* Individual Investigations of Topics of Interest
* Discussion of Selected Reading
* Conference Presentations and writing for Publication

Oakes critical against "let's fix teaching" mentality. She is arguing about offering opportunity and making social justice a reality rather than "fixing" and "improving."

* encourage students to ask
	* whose interest is being served?
	* whose interest is being ignored?

* think about this whenever you are asked to do something (e.g. in class)

Essay prompt:

"Provide arguments to make a case either for or against large lecture format teaching (a forced dichotomy).

Use learning theory and reading on teaching and learning environment design to support your arguments - be specific. Indicated why the selected theory is useful, i.e. don't just list it.

You do not need to cite every coinceivable theory or article/chapter. Please be selective but pointed. I want to see that you have digested the material and can use it in a new situation (transfer)."

Address the implications beyond yourself and UCSC. Use 3-5 sources.
